# AI Study Guide Generator - Resume Points

## 5 Professional Bullet Points for Your Resume:

• **Full-Stack AI Web Application**: Developed a comprehensive PDF study guide generator using React.js frontend and Express.js backend with TypeScript, featuring drag-and-drop file upload, real-time processing status, and responsive Material Design UI components built with Tailwind CSS and Radix UI primitives.

• **AI Integration & API Management**: Integrated Hugging Face Inference API with multiple AI models (BART-large-CNN for summarization, T5-base for text generation) to generate 500+ word summaries and 7+ questions per type, implementing robust fallback mechanisms and error handling for API rate limits and model availability issues.

• **Advanced Document Processing**: Built PDF text extraction pipeline using pdf-parse library with intelligent content chunking and cleaning algorithms, supporting files up to 10MB with automatic text validation and structured data extraction for academic content analysis.

• **Dynamic Question Generation System**: Engineered a multi-type question generation engine supporting 6 question formats (theoretical, application-based, numerical, MCQ, fill-in-blanks, true/false) with content-based answer generation, expandable UI cards, and comprehensive explanations for enhanced learning experience.

• **Modern Development Architecture**: Implemented full-stack application with Vite build system, TanStack React Query for state management, Zod schema validation, Drizzle ORM for type-safe database operations, and automated study guide export functionality with proper file headers and browser compatibility handling.

## Alternative Technical Focus Points:

### For Backend-Heavy Roles:
• **RESTful API Development**: Built Express.js REST API with TypeScript, implementing file upload handling via Multer, PDF text extraction using pdf-parse, session management, and structured JSON responses with comprehensive error handling and input validation using Zod schemas.

### For Frontend-Heavy Roles:  
• **React Component Architecture**: Designed modular React application with custom hooks, form validation using React Hook Form with Zod resolvers, real-time progress tracking, modal dialogs for user guidance, and responsive design patterns ensuring cross-device compatibility.

### For AI/ML Focus:
• **Machine Learning Pipeline**: Implemented AI-powered content analysis system using Hugging Face transformers for natural language processing, featuring text summarization with BART models, question generation using T5 architecture, and intelligent content chunking for optimal model performance.

### For UI/UX Focus:
• **User Experience Design**: Created intuitive interface with progressive disclosure patterns, real-time feedback systems, accessibility-compliant modal dialogs, drag-and-drop interactions, and comprehensive help documentation to guide users through complex AI processing workflows.
